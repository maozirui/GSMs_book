Fortran code for simulating water splash published in the [GSMs book](https://maozirui.github.io/publications/GSM-book-2024).



The FORTRAN code involves L-GSM and SPH solvers, with potential applications to other hydrodynamics problems. Please check the our [book](https://maozirui.github.io/publications/GSM-book-2024) or previous [paper](https://maozirui.github.io/publications/L-GSM_fluid_2019) for the detail about the model configuration.
